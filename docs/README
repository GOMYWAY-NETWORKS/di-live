Debian Installer for Live systems
=================================

Introduction
------------

Debian-installer (d-i) is the preferred way of installing debian based
systems. It runs in the initrd/initramfs (see notes/DebianInstaller).

Ubiquity is developed by and used in ubuntu as its graphical desktop
installer (alternative and server use pure d-i). Ubiquity uses d-i code
as its backend, is a complex beast, and unfortunately not very modular
(see notes/Ubiquity)

di-live's objective is to provide the ability to install a "live" debian
based system to the harddisk, leveraging the power/flexability of d-i,
with a completely modular implementation (least amount of assumptions)
that can be used by upstream (eg. as an ubiquity depends - seperation of
concerns).

Source structure
----------------

git-branches
    #vanilla    prestine code downloaded from upstream
    #master     patched upstream code and actual di-live code

    git-diff vanilla compat/
    git-diff vanilla d-i/


di-live     - drives the installation (similar to d-i's main-menu)
di-live.d/  - component directory (executed in alpha-numeric ordering)
d-i/        - upstream d-i source code
compat/     - compatibility scripts as d-i code assumes running in 
              initrd/initramfs

cli syntax
----------

The init script will execute di-live (on new vt) if the boot param 
"di-live" is present on /proc/cmdline. di-live may be executed manually
in a live system aswell.

Syntax: di-live [options]

Debian Installer Live

Drives the installation, executing components according to alpha-numeric
ordering, and responsible for dynamically assembling the menu and
executing components when they are selected.

Similar to d-i's main-menu, di-live's menu will only be visible when
debconf priority is low or medium. Priority is reduced when a component
fails, and returns to original level when next component completes 
successfully.

Options:
  -d --debug      Set DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer DEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline
