====================
v0.9.1 Release Notes
====================

* manual partitioning IFS bugfixi (took me ages to track down this bug)

    - Due to IFS issues, the user choice RET was not matched up with
      the available choices, so the choice key could not be returned.
      So, by default it would return the RET itself, which would result
      in a plugin error.
  
    - The plugin error would result in ask_user returning a failed 
      exitcode, which in turn result in a "No root filesystem" message.

* execute live-installer hooks in target chroot

      - cleaner code
      - allows hook scripts to be executed in live system as well

* start the installer prior to single user mode

      - doesn't make sense to run the demo functions if the user selects
        running the installer from the boot menu
  
      - the system takes longer to boot, uses up more memory and worst of
        all, it opens a window of vulnerability
  
      - it is highly recommended to include the kernel param "single" when
        specifying di-live, so the system won't continue loading by default
        post installation

* templates

    - changed reboot default to true
    - added mysql password templates
    - added postgresql password templates

* replaced overly verbose password messages

* imported DeconfPass related code common (used by mysql and pgsql)
